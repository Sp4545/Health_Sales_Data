## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Q2 2024 CMS Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) Daily Nurse Staffing dataset and CMS Provider Information to identify strategic sales opportunities for Clipboard Health. The goal is to pinpoint facilities and states with staffing shortages, heavy contractor reliance, and high turnover — all of which signal demand for Clipboard’s contract staffing solutions.

By understanding workforce trends across ownership types, geographic regions, and facility performance metrics, we empower the sales team to focus on high-impact outreach.

## 🎯 Objectives
Identify states with high contractor nurse usage

Pinpoint facilities most dependent on contract CNAs

Analyze staffing ratings in relation to contractor hours

Explore ownership-based workforce trends

Understand how turnover rates affect staffing stability

Recommend data-driven sales strategies

## 📂 Datasets Used
CMS PBJ Daily Nurse Staffing (2024 Q2) – Reports facility-level staffing hours split by role and employment type (employee vs. contractor)

CMS Provider Information – Contains facility ownership, bed count, staffing ratings, and turnover data

Merged using the CMS Certification Number (CCN) for precise facility-level insights.

## 🔍 Key Insights
## ✅ State-Level Trends
States like [Insert State(s)] exhibit high contractor reliance, especially for CNAs, indicating staffing shortages.

Lower staffing hours per resident per day in certain states suggest urgent needs for workforce support.

## ✅ Facility-Level Patterns
Some facilities have exceptionally high CNA contractor hours—ideal targets for long-term staffing partnerships.

Facilities relying heavily on contract CNAs often have lower staffing ratings, suggesting workforce instability.

## ✅ Ownership and Turnover
For-profit facilities have the highest turnover rates, particularly for RNs, indicating instability and ongoing hiring needs.

Government-owned facilities generally report higher staffing levels and lower turnover, showing more workforce stability.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the findings, here’s how Clipboard Health can tailor its sales and outreach strategy:

Target High-Contractor-Reliance States
Focus sales efforts on states with high contractor hours, especially where CNA reliance is growing. Offer scalable staffing packages to meet surging demand.

Prioritize Top Contractor-Dependent Facilities
Directly engage with facilities showing the highest contractor usage. Propose long-term workforce partnerships, not just short-term fill-ins.

Support Low-Rated Facilities with Consistent Staffing
Facilities with lower staffing ratings and high CNA contractor use may face compliance issues. Position Clipboard as a stabilizing force with reliable staffing solutions.

Focus on For-Profit Facilities with High Turnover
These facilities struggle to retain permanent staff and often rely on temp workers. Offer cost-effective, flexible contract-to-hire options that reduce admin overhead and hiring churn.

Fill Gaps in Understaffed States
States with lower staffing hours per resident should be seen as compliance risk zones. Clipboard can step in to help facilities meet staffing minimums and avoid penalties.
